# Web Socket System(WSS) Service Configuration

The WSS System Service library should be configured through MCC. When user adds the WSS System Service into a project, all the required dependencies and components are added automatically into the the projects MCC configuration. The user can make changes according to the application requirement in the WSS System Service configuration menu.

The following figure shows the MCC configuration window for configuring the WSS System Service and a brief description of various configuration options.

1. Open the MCC 

2. Click on the "+" button to add the WSS Service Module from the Available components into the Project Graph. This will trigger the auto activation of the dependent modules.Click on 'Yes' in the confirmation window popped up for component auto activation.
