## Abstraction Model

The Wi-Fi System Service library provides an abstraction to the Wi-Fi driver API's to provide following functionalities.

-   Simple APIs to enable/disable STA mode

-   Simple APIs to enable/disable AP mode

-   Self Healing

-   Reduce code user has to write

-   Reduce time to develop and maintain


The following diagram depicts the Wi-Fi System Service abstraction model.

## How The Library Works

By default, MHC generated code provides all the functionalities to enable STA or AP mode application. User needs to configure the required STA or AP mode configuration using MHC.

Multiple clients can register for callbacks to the Wi-Fi System Service Library for getting Wi-Fi connectivity update information. Additionally clients can make request to the Wi-Fi System Service Library using SYS\_WIFI\_CtrlMsg\(\) API. More information can be found in the SYS\_WIFI\_CtrlMsg examples.
