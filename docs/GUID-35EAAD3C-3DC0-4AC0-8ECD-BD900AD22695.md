# App Debug System Service Configuration

The enabling/ disabling of App Debug System Service library should be done through the MHC. More on how any component can integrate this library into his own component can be found by going through some of the system services like the MQTT, NET, and Wifi System Service.

Note that App Debug System Service component does not have any conifgurations to be done separately. All the configurations needs to come via the other components using it.
