# Wi-Fi System Service Configuration

The Wi-Fi System Service library should be configured through MHC\(MPLAB Harmony Configurator\). The following figure shows the MHC configuration window for configuring the Wi-Fi System Service and a brief description of various configuration options.

When user select the Wi-Fi System Service library, all the required dependencies are added automatically into the MHC configuration. In the Wi-Fi System Service library, user can select the operating device mode as station\(STA\) or access point\(AP\) and make a required changes in the selected mode.

       0 - scan all the channels
       1 to 13 - - scan on specified channel

    Scan Mode:
      ACTIVE  : Requst Active Scan
      PASSIVE : Request Passive Scan

    SSID List(Active Scan Only):
      User preferred SSIDs list for scanning.
      Maximum 4 SSIDs of maximum 32 characters allowed. 
        e.g. DEMO_AP1,DEMO_AP2,DEMO_AP3,DEMO_AP4).
      This field is only applicable for Active Scan.

      Time(in milliseconds) spent on each passive channel listening for beacons.
        
    Number Of Probes:
      Number of probe requests to be sent for each scan slot when "SSID List" field is empty.
      Number of probe requests to be sent for each ssid to scan in each scan slot when preferred "SSID List" is configured.
      This field is only applicable for Active Scan.

    Scan Match Mode:
      FIND_ALL: Scan for all matches
