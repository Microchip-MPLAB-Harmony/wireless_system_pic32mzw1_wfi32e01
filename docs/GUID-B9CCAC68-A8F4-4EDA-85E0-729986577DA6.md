# Wi-Fi System Service Configuration

The Wi-Fi System Service library should be configured through MHC\(MPLAB Harmony Configurator\). The following figure shows the MHC configuration window for configuring the Wi-Fi System Service and a brief description of various configuration options.

When user select the Wi-Fi System Service library, all the required dependencies are added automatically into the MHC configuration. In the Wi-Fi System Service library, user can select the operating device mode as station\(STA\) or access point\(AP\) and make a required changes in the selected mode.

## Configuration Options:

Using MHC menu,user can select required device mode as a station\(STA\) or access point\(AP\).

### Device Mode:

```

### STA Mode:

```
SSID:

    Server Domain Name CN : Server domain name against which either server certificate's subject alternative name(SAN) or common name(CN) shall be matched for successful enterprise connection
    Certificate Date : Enter a date between the date of certificate creation and date of expiration of certificate in UTC time format. 
    CA Certificate Format : Indicates the format of the CA Certificate that is used – PEM / DER
    CA Certificate File Name : Indicates the name of the header file that has to be included which contains the CA Certificate in the form of a hex array and the size of the hex array.
    CA Certificate Module Name : Indicates the name of the array within the header file.

    Private Certificate File Name : Indicates the name of the header file that has to be included which contains the Private Certificate in the form of a hex array and the size of the hex array.
    Private Certificate Module Name : Indicates the name of the array within the header file.
    Private Key Format : Indicates the format of the Private Key that is used – PEM / DER
    Private Key File Name : Indicates the name of the header file that has to be included which contains the Private Key in the form of a hex array and the size of the hex array.
    Private Key Module Name : Indicates the name of the array within the header file.
    - Make sure that the date provided is within the validity period of the certificate.
    - Make sure that the header files provided are imported into the project to avoid compilation error of missing file.
    - More information can be found in "WFI32 Enterprise Security Application Note" Salesforce knowledge base article.

```

### Enabling Wi-Fi System Service

All of the required files are automatically added into the MPLAB X IDE<br />project by the MHC when the library is selected for use.
